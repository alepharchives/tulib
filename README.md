# EHF - Erlang Helper Function Toolbox

This is a collection of useful Erlang functions that I collected over
time. It can be used as snippets or be called directly from here.


## Categories

Every module is a self-contained categery that I tried to keep close
to the Erlang/OTP names.

Either I found them or wrote them myself. So I tried to keep
credits were it's due.
