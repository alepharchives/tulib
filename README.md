# Erlang Function Toolbox
This is a collection of useful Erlang functions that I collected over
time. It can be used as snippets or be called directly from here.

## Categories
Every module is a self-contained categery that I tried to keep close
to the Erlang/OTP names.

* OS
* Shell
* File
* List
* String
* Dict
* Math
* Process
* Messaging

## Credits / Copyrights
Either I found them or wrote them myself. So I tried to keep
credits were it's due.
